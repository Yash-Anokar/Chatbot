C++ Introduction
1. What is C++?
C++ is a general-purpose programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 at Bell
Labs. It is an extension of the C programming language and supports object-oriented programming
(OOP).
2. Features of C++
• Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
• Fast and Efficient
• Portable and Platform Independent
• Supports Low-level and High-level Programming
• Rich Standard Library (STL)
3. Structure of a C++ Program
A basic C++ program contains the following parts:
• Preprocessor Directives (#include )
• Main Function (int main())
• Statements and Logic
• Return Statement (return 0;)
4. Example Program
Example: Hello World Program in C++
#include
using namespace std;
int main() {
cout << "Hello, World!";
return 0;
}
5. Applications of C++
• Game Development
• System Programming
• Embedded Systems
• Desktop Applications
• Competitive Programming
